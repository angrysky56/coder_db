| JVM Optimization | Optimization for JVM performance | 0-10 |

## Testing Metrics

| Metric | Description | Scale |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| Test Coverage | Percentage of code covered by tests | 0-100% |
| Test Types | Variety of test types (unit, integration, etc.) | Count |
| Test Quality | Effectiveness of test cases | 0-10 |
| Mocking Approach | Appropriate use of test doubles | 0-10 |

## Security Metrics

| Metric | Description | Scale |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| OWASP Compliance | Freedom from common vulnerabilities | 0-10 |
| Input Validation | Proper validation of inputs | 0-10 |
| Authentication/Authorization | Secure identity and access management | 0-10 |
| Data Protection | Protection of sensitive data | 0-10 |

## Workflow Integration

### Automated Assessment

The following tools can be integrated to automatically calculate quality metrics:

1. **Linters & Static Analyzers**:
   - Python: flake8, pylint, mypy
   - JavaScript: ESLint, TSLint
   - Java: PMD, Checkstyle, SpotBugs

2. **Code Complexity Tools**:
   - Python: radon, mccabe
   - JavaScript: complexity-report
   - Language-agnostic: SonarQube

3. **Documentation Analyzers**:
   - Python: pydocstyle, interrogate
   - JavaScript: JSDoc, documentationjs
   - Java: Javadoc tools

4. **Performance Measurement**:
   - Benchmarking frameworks
   - Profilers for each language
   - Memory monitoring tools

### Quality Score Calculation

Each code pattern can be assigned a composite quality score based on weighted metrics:

```
QualityScore = (0.25 * CorrectnessScore) + 
               (0.20 * PerformanceScore) + 
               (0.20 * CodeQualityScore) + 
               (0.15 * DocumentationScore) + 
               (0.20 * MaintainabilityScore)
```

Weights can be adjusted based on the specific needs and priorities of your projects.

### Storage and Filtering

When storing code patterns:

1. Calculate and store quality metrics with each pattern
2. Allow filtering based on minimum quality thresholds
3. Sort search results by quality score
4. Provide visual indicators of quality (e.g., badges, stars)

## Quality Improvement Workflow

For patterns with potential but suboptimal quality:

1. **Identify Issues**: Flag specific metrics that need improvement
2. **Suggest Improvements**: Provide automated suggestions for enhancement
3. **Version Tracking**: Store both original and improved versions
4. **Comparative Analysis**: Show improvements between versions

## Implementation Notes

1. **Balance Rigor with Practicality**: Not all metrics are equally important for every code pattern
2. **Context Matters**: Consider the intended use case when evaluating
3. **Language-Specific Standards**: Apply appropriate standards for each language
4. **User Feedback Integration**: Allow users to provide quality feedback
5. **Continuous Refinement**: Regularly update quality assessment criteria

By applying these quality metrics, the memory system ensures that stored code patterns are not only functional but also maintainable, efficient, and demonstrate best practices in software development.
