# Coder DB - AI Memory Enhancement System

A structured memory system for AI assistants to enhance coding capabilities using database integration utilizing Claude Desktop and MCP Servers.

## Overview

This system leverages multiple database types to create a comprehensive memory system for coding assistance:

1. **Qdrant Vector Database**: For semantic search and retrieval of code patterns
2. **SQLite Database**: For structured algorithm storage and versioning
3. **Knowledge Graph**: For representing relationships between coding concepts

## Database Usage Guide

### Qdrant Memory Storage

For storing and retrieving code snippets, patterns, and solutions by semantic meaning.

**What to store:**
- Reusable code patterns with explanations
- Solutions to complex problems
- Best practices and design patterns
- Documentation fragments and explanations

**Enhanced Metadata:**
- Language and framework details
- Complexity level (simple, intermediate, advanced)
- Dependencies and requirements
- Quality metrics (cyclomatic complexity, documentation coverage)
- User feedback and ratings

**Example Usage:**
```python
# Storing a code pattern
information = {
    "type": "code_pattern",
    "language": "python",
    "name": "Context Manager Pattern",
    "code": "class MyContextManager:\n    def __enter__(self):\n        # Setup code\n        return self\n    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):\n        # Cleanup code\n        pass",
    "explanation": "Context managers provide a clean way to manage resources like file handles.",
    "tags": ["python", "resource management", "context manager"],
    "complexity": "intermediate",
    "quality_metrics": {
        "cyclomatic_complexity": 2,
        "documentation_coverage": 0.85
    },
    "user_rating": 4.5
}
# Store in Qdrant
```

### SQLite Algorithm Database

For maintaining a structured catalog of algorithms with proper versioning.

**Database Schema:**
- `algorithms`: Basic algorithm information (name, description)
- `algorithm_versions`: Different versions of algorithm implementations
- `algorithm_categories`: Categories like Sorting, Searching, Graph, etc.
- `performance_metrics`: Performance data for different implementations
- `improvements`: Tracked improvements between versions
- `change_logs`: Detailed logs of changes with rationale and context

**Version Diffing:**
- Store diffs between algorithm versions
- Track performance improvements across versions
- Document rationale behind changes

**Example Query:**
```sql
-- Find all sorting algorithms with performance metrics
SELECT a.name, a.description, v.version_number, p.time_complexity, p.space_complexity
FROM algorithms a
JOIN algorithm_versions v ON a.id = v.algorithm_id
JOIN performance_metrics p ON v.id = p.version_id
JOIN algorithm_category_mapping m ON a.id = m.algorithm_id
JOIN algorithm_categories c ON m.category_id = c.id
WHERE c.name = 'Sorting'
ORDER BY a.name, v.version_number DESC;

-- Get change logs for a specific algorithm
SELECT v.version_number, c.change_description, c.rationale, c.created_at
FROM algorithm_versions v
JOIN change_logs c ON v.id = c.version_id
WHERE v.algorithm_id = 5
ORDER BY v.version_number;
```

### Knowledge Graph Integration

For representing complex relationships between coding concepts, patterns, and solutions.

**Advanced Ontology:**
- Algorithm
- DesignPattern
- CodeConcept
- ProblemType
- Solution
- Framework
- Library
- Language

**Rich Relation Types:**
- IMPLEMENTS (Algorithm → CodeConcept)
- SOLVES (DesignPattern → ProblemType)
- OPTIMIZES (Algorithm → Performance)
- RELATED_TO (Any → Any)
- IMPROVES_UPON (Solution → Solution)
- ALTERNATIVELY_SOLVES (Solution → ProblemType)
- EXTENDS (Pattern → Pattern)
- DEPENDS_ON (Solution → Library)
- COMPATIBLE_WITH (Framework → Language)

**Graph Analytics:**
- Identify frequently co-occurring patterns
- Discover emerging trends in coding practices
- Map problem domains to solution approaches

## Usage Workflows

### 1. Enhanced Problem-Solving Workflow

When facing a new coding problem:

1. **Context Gathering**:
   - Clearly define the problem and constraints
   - Identify performance requirements and environment details
   - Document project-specific considerations

2. **Memory Querying**:
   - Break down the problem using sequential thinking
   - Query Qdrant for similar solutions: `qdrant-find-memories("efficient way to traverse binary tree")`
   - Filter results by language, complexity, and quality metrics
   - Check algorithm database for relevant algorithms: `SELECT * FROM algorithms WHERE name LIKE '%tree%'`
   - Explore knowledge graph for related concepts and alternative approaches

3. **Solution Application**:
   - Test and verify solution in REPL
   - Document performance characteristics
   - Compare against alternatives

4. **Feedback Loop**:
   - Store successful solution back in Qdrant with detailed metadata
   - Log performance metrics and usage context
   - Update knowledge graph connections

### 2. Pattern Learning & Storage

When discovering a useful pattern:

1. **Automated Documentation**:
   - Generate initial documentation using AI tools
   - Include detailed usage examples
   - Document edge cases and limitations

2. **Quality Assessment**:
   - Run linters and static analyzers to ensure code quality
   - Calculate and store quality metrics
   - Validate against best practices

3. **Metadata Enrichment**:
   - Document the pattern with clear examples
   - Add comprehensive metadata (language, complexity, dependencies)
   - Apply consistent tagging from controlled vocabulary

4. **Knowledge Integration**:
   - Store in Qdrant with appropriate tags and explanation
   - Create knowledge graph connections to related concepts
   - Add to SQL database if it's an algorithm implementation
   - Suggest automatic connections based on content similarity

### 3. Project Setup & Boilerplate

When starting a new project:

1. **Template Selection**:
   - Choose from library of project templates
   - Customize based on project requirements
   - Select language, framework, and testing tools

2. **Automated Setup**:
   - Generate project structure with proper directory layout
   - Set up version control with appropriate .gitignore
   - Configure linting and code quality tools
   - Initialize testing framework

3. **Best Practices Integration**:
   - Query memory system for relevant boilerplate code
   - Retrieve best practices for the specific project type
   - Use stored documentation templates for initial setup
   - Configure CI/CD based on project requirements

## Security & Data Integrity

1. **Access Controls**:
   - Role-based access for sensitive code repositories
   - Permissions for viewing vs. modifying memories

2. **Backup & Recovery**:
   - Regular backups of Qdrant and SQLite databases
   - Version control for knowledge graph
   - Recovery procedures for data corruption

3. **Sensitive Information**:
   - Sanitize code examples to remove sensitive data
   - Validate code snippets before storage
   - Flag and restrict access to sensitive patterns

## Monitoring & Analytics

1. **Usage Tracking**:
   - Monitor which patterns are most frequently retrieved
   - Track search query patterns to identify knowledge gaps
   - Log user ratings and feedback

2. **Performance Metrics**:
   - Monitor database response times
   - Track memory usage and scaling requirements
   - Optimize queries based on usage patterns

## Maintenance Guidelines

1. **Quality over Quantity**: Only store high-quality, well-documented code
2. **Regular Review**: Periodically review and update stored patterns
3. **Contextual Storage**: Include usage context with each stored pattern
4. **Versioning**: Track improvements and versions in SQLite
5. **Tagging Consistency**: Use controlled vocabulary for better retrieval
6. **Performance Optimization**: Regularly optimize database queries
7. **Feedback Integration**: Update patterns based on usage feedback

## Getting Started

1. Store your first code memory:
   ```
   qdrant-store-memory(json.dumps({
       "type": "code_pattern",
       "name": "Python decorator pattern",
       "code": "def my_decorator(func):\n    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n        # Do something before\n        result = func(*args, **kwargs)\n        # Do something after\n        return result\n    return wrapper",
       "explanation": "Decorators provide a way to modify functions without changing their code.",
       "tags": ["python", "decorator", "metaprogramming"],
       "complexity": "intermediate"
   }))
   ```

2. Retrieve it later:
   ```
   qdrant-find-memories("python decorator pattern")
   ```
